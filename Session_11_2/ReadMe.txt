The script "analysis.R" is the master file. It loads all data (in Rdata format) and the required packages. You may need to install the package "Synth".

On execution the script sources all other scripts and runs the analyses referenced the paper.

For the script to work properly you have to adjust the path in the file "analysis.R" by changing the declaration of the object "dir".
